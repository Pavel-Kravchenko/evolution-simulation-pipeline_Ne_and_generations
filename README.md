# evolution-simulation-pipeline_Ne_and_generations
This is the evolution simulator for calculate all possible ranges of Ne, generations and mutations

This pipeline is the part of bioengineering and bioinformatics faculty coursework

The pipeline creates the range of sequences with different evolution parameters

## Before you start

The pipeline is availble only for <i>Linux</i> users </br>
Make sure that you have installed all components:
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6 or upper https://www.python.org/
<li>Biopython 1.70 or upper http://biopython.org/
<li>R and R-Studio with basic packages https://www.rstudio.com/
</ul>


## Getting started

### Installation

First of all you have to ```clone``` this directory</br></br>
```git clone https://github.com/Pavel-Kravchenko/evolution-simulation-pipeline_Ne_and_generations/```</br></br>
Then ```cd``` in evolution-simulation-pipeline_Ne_and_generations</br></br>
```cd evolution-simulation-pipeline_Ne_and_generations```</br></br>
And ```tar``` Species_files.tar.gz</br></br>
```tar -xvf Species_files.tar.gz```</br></br>
Command ```ls -1``` and make sure that you have all files in your directory
```
alignment_reader.py
README.md
R_plotter.R
script1.sh
script2.sh
script3.sh
Species_files
Species_files.tar.gz
```
Now you are ready to start.
Command 
```bash script1.sh``` and wait when the program have completed.
You are expected to receive such demo results in Species_files:


If everything gone well, clear Species_files and copy your ```.fasta``` file in Species_files</br></br>
And command</br></br>
```bash script1.sh```</br>
